## 🌍 Real Location System (Important)

Vyntrix does **NOT** fake locations.

Each location maps to a **real node directory**, just like enterprise cloud providers:

- Singapore  
- Germany  
- USA  
- UK  
- Japan  
- UAE  
- Canada  
- Australia  
- More can be added easily  

Every VM:
- Is created inside its selected location
- Keeps disks, configs, and seeds isolated
- Can be moved between locations safely
